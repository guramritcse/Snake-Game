# Snake-Game
---
This repository stores the code for my self project: Snake Game completed during Autumn, 2022.
- This is an implementation of the Nokia snake game in which the player collects yellow fruits without colliding
- I have added a high score feature
- Listen to your own music while playing the game

## Running the code
Use "python snake.py --theme /path/to/music" to run the code
